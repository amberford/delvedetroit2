			<h3 class="orange">Pingree Years</h3>
			<div id="article-wrapper">
				<p>Hazen S. Pingree served as Detroit's mayor from 1890 to 1897, leaving office only after being elected governor of Michigan. He was named the fourth best mayor in all of American history in a poll of scholars for Melvin Holli’s 1999 book, “The American Mayor.”</p>
				<p>His tough-love form of social reform, historians note, was the forerunner for the reforms of the Progressive Era. The Republican mayor is best known for turning vacant land into vegetable patches to feed the city’s needy during the economic downturn of the 1890s.</p>
				<p>Pingree promoted the regulation of railroad rates, equal taxation, and municipal ownership of public utilities. He also supported the direct election of U.S. senators, an eight-hour workday, an income tax, primary elections and the abolition of child labor. There is a statue of him in the Grand Circus Park in Detroit, commemorating him as "The Idol of the People." He died in London, England in 1901.</p>
