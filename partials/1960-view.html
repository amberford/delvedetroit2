			<h3 class="teal">THE MOTOWN SOUND</h3>
			<div id="article-wrapper">
			<p>In 1959, boxer, assembly line worker and songwriter Berry Gordy Jr. used an $800 family loan to start a record company in Detroit. Motown achieved spectacular success for a small record company: 79 records in the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot 100 record chart between 1960 and 1969. By 1966, Motown grossed $20 million dollars.</p>
			<p> Motown played an important role in the racial integration of pop music as a Black-owned record label with significantly crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels were the most successful proponents of what came to be known as the Motown Sound, a style of soul music with a distinct pop influence.</p>
			<p>Popular Motown artists include Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, The Supremes, Stevie Wonder, The Four Tops and The Miracles.</p>
